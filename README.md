# exerciseApp
Full Stack Exercise Web Application

This is a React/Express application that uses MongoDB as a database.
It takes exercise inputs and displays them in a table for the user.
They can then be deleted or edited depending on the users needs.

To use the application, you must run "npm install"
A database is also required. You can edit the .env file to access the desired database. I used mongoDB.
